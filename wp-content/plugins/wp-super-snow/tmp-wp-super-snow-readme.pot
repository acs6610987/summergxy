msgid "If you increase the number of snowlfakes — yes. WP Super Snow can eat up a lot of CPU, even on modern computers when there are a large number of elements being moved around the screen at once. The default configuration that comes with WP Super Snow may have notably lower CPU utilization as it doesn't include a lot of extras, and the default number of snowflakes is reduced to improve speed. Consider lowering the speed; and also the amount of snowflakes to help reduce CPU use even further."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "note: WP Super Snow will attempt to use GPU-based hardware acceleration to animate the snow. Having GPU acceleration can help in reducing CPU utilization. Most modern browsers will support this; WP Super Snow takes advantage whenever it's possible (automatically)."
